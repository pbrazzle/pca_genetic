TODOs:
	- Work on JSON system for simulation/report files
	- Read through and add TODOs for refactors
	- Plan full scale tests
	- Consider data inputs from online sources
	
Simulations should be able to report data about itself
	Execution time
	Average/best fitness per generation
	Best model parameters
	
File I/O should be much more robust
	JSON format
	
Notes on JSON:
	All JSON objects begin with a '{' and end with '}'
	Each object consists of an unordered list of key-value pairs
	All keys are strings surrounded by double quotes, while values can take many forms
	Values can be number, strings, arrays, or objects
