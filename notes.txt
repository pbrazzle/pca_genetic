TODOs:
	The program should be able to read instructions from a file
	For example:
		File contains info about Algorithm, Model, and training data
		Run for X generations/run until converged/whatever

	The files should be able to chain up simulations and print out results
	This way we can run a ton of them and let it go witout recompiling/rerunning

Instruction file format:
${Algorithm Name}
${Generation Size}
${Mutation Chance}
${Mutation Size}
${Param Range}
${Fitness Calculator Class Name}
${Parent Selector Class Name}
${Parent Combiner Class Name}
${Model Class Name}
"Model Specific Data" 				#For LinearGeneticModel this will be a single line for data length
${Number of Training Data Entries}		
"Training Data"					#For now this will be CSV lines of Input then Output
${Number of generations to run}
\n
...						#We can chain up several algorithm runs
