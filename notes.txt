TODOs:
	- Write test for linear model (identity matrix)
	
	- Integrate JSON into Simulation Files - Derive from JSONSerializable
	- Plan full scale tests
	- Add ModelInput/Output classes for images
	- Write lots and lots of tests
	
Simulations should be able to report data about itself
	Execution time
	Average/best fitness per generation
	Best model parameters
	
Feature List for Report:
	- Build a CNN model for image classification
	- Train the model using the genetic algorithm
	- Read simulation instructions from JSON file
	- Write simulation report to file
	
TODOs for report:
	- Implement CNN related models (Conv, downsample, neural, interconnect)
	- Gather training data for image classification
	- Write test for image classification model
