Notes for genetic algorithm implementation

User provides fitness function and training data
Runs for given number of generations
Model selects highest scoring solution at the end

API Data Structures
- Fitness function
- Input function
- Genetic Model
- Model Settings

Internal Data Structures
- Solution
- Generation

Use Cases
- Given a fitness function, and number of generations, train the model
- Given a trained model, run an arbitrary function
